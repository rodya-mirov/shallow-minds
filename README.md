# shallow-minds: A short course on artifical neural networks.

This will be taught through a series of Jupyter notebooks.  Relevant code will be captured in python modules (currently just `basic_nn.py`), and these modules will be sufficient to compare the effectiveness of various techniques.

These modules are *not* intended to replace modern, performant libraries such as Theano, Torch, or TensorFlow; instead, they are intended to educate the reader on the basic techniques and start-of-the-art variations.  They are also intended for the reader to be able to experiment with the code in a hassle-free manner with as low an entry barrier as possible.

Notebooks are numbered, and the reader is encouraged to read them in order, as notebooks may reference code or reasoning from an earlier notebook.  As soon as this is possible (the notebook titled "A First Simulation") there will be enough moving parts for the reader to experiment on his/her own and discover what the advantages and disadvantages of different choices are.

**Required technologies:** `python 3`, `numpy`, and `jupyter notebook`.  Any installation of `anaconda` with python 3 will cover everything you need. Python 2 users are encouraged to upgrade, although the code should be easy enough to downgrade by hand. It is assumed that the reader can open and interact with jupyter notebooks; if not, Jupyter has an excellent <a href="https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">guide to getting started.</a>
